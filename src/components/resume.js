                Graduate of UCSD Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp with multiple years
                in Hospitality, most recently as a Operations Team Specialist.
                My ambition is to apply and successfully implement my expertise
                of heart-felt care from Hospitality combined with my creative
                thinking and understanding of programming to build
                applications,websites and databases semantically beautiful with
                those I interact with.
                <hr />
                Possessing skills of unparalled customer service and innovative
                understanding of programming, I believe I am able to offer a
                quality product and service like no other. Time management,
                critical thinking and problem solving paired with a passion to
                communicate and work cohesively allows me to truly enjoy an
                office environment that thrives on character,passion and
                culture.
                <hr />
                My goal is to assist, create and inject passion with charisma
                into every keystroke. Transforming ideas to products to increase
                UI, UX and elevated expectations of how efficency inceases
                quality of lie is my "commit" to the respository of life.
